#Q2

$H_0: \beta=1$ 
$H_1: \beta \neq 1$

significance level $\alpha=0.05$

We can learn from example 19.3, the 95% CI is (0.672, 0.931). This interval does not includes 1, therefore we reject the H0. The average changes in ‘headcirc’ when ‘gestage’ increases by one week. And ‘momage’ stays constant.
